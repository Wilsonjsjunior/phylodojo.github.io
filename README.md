## Phylogenetic Data Analysis in Practice
### a space reserved for immersive learning...in phylogenetics

This page is here to support the workshop: Phylogenetic Data Analysis in Practice.  

The first workshop will be at the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco from April 16th - April 20th. This workshop will be focused on the basics of how to make inferences about evolutionary history using moecular sequence data with some background on theory.

```markdown
We will cover the following topics:
Day 1: Tree thinking & Data Acquisition
Day 2: Alignment & Alignment Uncertainty
Day 3: Model Testing & Maximum Likelihood Data Analysis
Day 4: Bayesian Data Analysis, Partitioned Data
Day 5: Introduction to R for Phylogenetics, Assistance with data analysis and interpretation.
```
I will post a more detailed schedule close to the start of the workshop.

## Things you will need **before** the first day of the workshop:

1. Laptop computer with wifi capabilities and **two** usb ports
2. 8+ GB USB drive

4. download and install [Aliview](http://ormbunkar.se/aliview/)
5. download and install [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) 
6. download and install [EditPad Lite](https://www.editpadlite.com/download.html) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
7. download and install [SequenceMatrix](http://www.ggvaidya.com/taxondna/)
8. download and install [Tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/)
9. download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - If you have questions about how to install R, be sure to read the [FAQs](https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html)
10. It will also be useful for you if you have some sequence data of your own that comes from organisms for which you have some familiarity.
